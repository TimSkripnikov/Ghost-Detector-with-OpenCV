# ðŸ‘» Ghost Detector with OpenCV

This project implements a basic ghost detection system using feature matching techniques in OpenCV. The goal is to identify all instances of known ghost images within a larger test image. It was developed as a practical exercise to strengthen skills in image processing and computer vision using the `cv2` library.

## Project Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Practice using **OpenCV** for real-world image processing tasks  
- Understand how to work with **grayscale/color image formats**, **feature extraction**, and **homography**
- Learn how to use **SIFT** for keypoint detection and **BFMatcher** for matching features between images  
- Apply **perspective transforms** to locate and outline detected objects in an image

---

## How It Works

1. Load a set of known "ghost" images from a directory
2. Convert both the input (search) image and ghost images to grayscale
3. Use **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** to extract keypoints and descriptors
4. Match the features between each ghost image and the input image using **BFMatcher**
5. Estimate the location of each ghost using **findHomography** and draw its outline on the image
